## Initial Repository Code

The repository contains some initial Java code to help your project. These are under the [src/main/java/uoa/lavs](src/main/java/uoa/lavs) folder. The following code is supplied:
* [mainframe](src/main/java/uoa/lavs/mainframe): the interfaces for sending requests to and receiving responses from the mainframe. You will need to use the [Connection](src/main/java/uoa/lavs/mainframe/Connection.java) interface in your code: we have provided two implementations of this interface in the [simulator](src/main/java/uoa/lavs/mainframe/simulator/) folder.
* [Utility](src/main/java/uoa/lavs/utility/): a utility for calculating loan repayments.

  In addition, there are some unit tests in [src/test/java/uoa/lavs/](src/test/java/uoa/lavs/) folder.
